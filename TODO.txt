=== FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

- Reply to global requests with SSH_MSG_REQUEST_FAILURE.

- Open channel for a SSH "session" [see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254#section-6.1].


=== FIXES

- Select algorithms based on client/server lists from their
  SSH_MSG_KEXINIT messages.

- Properly handle value 1 in 'first_kex_packet_follows' of received
  SSH_MSG_KEXINIT message.


=== IMPORTANT MISSING SECURITY FEATURES

- In key exchange, verify that the server key belongs to the connected
  server (and remember keys for known servers).

- Support re-keying.

- Fix comparisons with 'memcmp' to prevent timing attacks.


=== RFC COMPLIANCE

- (maybe) support old algorithms still marked as REQUIRED by RFC 4253:
  - MAC:  "hmac-sha1" 
  - cipher: "3des-cbc"
  - public key verification: "ssh-dss"
